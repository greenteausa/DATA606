# DATA606 Captstone project

Title:Mitigation strategies in public health crises: evaluating the successes and failures in the COVID-19 pandemic

Project Aim: 
1. Explore  COVID-19 global datasets with mitigation and mobility information to gain insights on the pandemic and mobility trends and impact of mitigation efforts.
2. Visualize the trends and patterns with animated graphs and charts for easy understanding.
3. Provide recommendations on the most or least effective mitigation efforts for public education and policy guidelines.

Research Questions:
1. What mitigation impacts the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases positively or negatively? 
2. Is that impact significant enough to recommend to policy makers?
3. Can mobility data show how mitigation is tightly followed in each countries?
4. Is there any correlation between mobility trend and the number of COVID-19 confirmed cases?

Datasets

1. Global COVID-19 confirmed cases by date: Provided by the Johns Hopkins University, COVID-19 confirmed cases were tracked in 266 countries. Data is accumulated from 1/22 until 6/05 with spatial coordinates. Total 266 rows and 140 columns. Available at: https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19/blob/master/csse_covid_19_data/csse_covid_19_time_series/time_series_covid19_confirmed_global.csv
2. COVID-19 Mitigation effort by governments: Provided by the University of Oxford, 8 containment and closure policies, 4 economic policies, 5 health system policy by 173 countries, coded data collected from 1/1 until 6/6. Total 27,323 rows and 41 columns. Available at: https://github.com/OxCGRT/covid-policy-tracker/tree/master/data
3. Mobility data during pandemic: Provided by Google, mobility was tracked by 6 categories in 132 countries, recorded positive or negative based on baseline from 2/19 until 5/29. Total 477,322 rows and 11 columns. Available at: https://www.google.com/covid19/mobility/
4. Countries of the world data: Provided by CIA, contains 227 rows of countries with 20 columns. This has region, population density, GDP, and other interesting data. Available at: https://www.kaggle.com/fernandol/countries-of-the-world

*Since first three datasets will be continuously updated by their own sites, codebook will use the original repository instead of this github repository. Readme file will be updated with the final dates used on the project.
